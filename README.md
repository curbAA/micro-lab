# micro:lab
"micro:lab" is a testing tool targeted towards young students for learning, testing, and developing with the BBC micro:bit. This allows them to input commands from the application to their micro:bit or plot data from the microbit into the aplication. It was designed with the intention of easy and intuitive deployment/implementation. 



## Installation Setup
### Prequisities
- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/es/)
- A BBC micro:bit
- Microsoft MakeCode (Recomended for this application customization)
- Winrar or any `".zip"` file uncompressor (Unnecesary for Windows 10 users)
### Installing
- First of all, create a directory in your machine and name it whatever you like, this is where you will download this repository.

- **If you have Git installed:** just do git init in your repository and set the origin remote to my directory and do ```"git pull origin master"```.

- **If you don't have Git installed:** simply download a zip file to the directory you created and uncompress it with Winrar or something like that.

- **Get your micro:bit** and plug it into your computer - you'll have to flash the `".hex"` file from the `"microbit files"` into your micro:bit for this to work.

- Open a terminal in the directory you installed micro:lab and run `npm install` for installing all the dependencies.

- **Last, but not least, you will have to check in your machine in what port your micro:bit is connected** for Windows 10, you will have to open up "device manager" from the start menu, go to "ports (COM & LPT)" and checkout if you have like "COM3", "COM5", or something like that in there. Whatever it says, remember the port, open up your text editor, go to the micro:lab directory, go to "server" and open up "server.js", when you are in there, search for the variable "serialPortID" and change it to the value you got from the "device manager". 



## Deployment
- Before running this, make sure you don't have any programs, like MakeCode, that read serial ports, becouse they will negate micro:lab access to those ports.

- For running micro:lab in your computer, you'll have to open up a terminal and go to the directory where you installed micro:lab and run `npm start`. This will start an express server in your local network in the port `3222` by default.

- Open up your web navigator of choice and type `"localhost:3222/home"` in the navigation bar - now you have your application running in your local network.

## Common problems
If you aren't receiving any data from the micro:bit when executing the aplication, this could be:
- You are not using the correct `"serialPortID"` (change it in the `"server.js"` file)
- You have another program opened that uses serial port readings (like MakeCode, for example)
- You don't have your micro:bit plugged in correctly (try other USB port)
- You touched too much your micro:bit without conscent and now it's mad at you...yes, really. For some reason when you touch the electronic components behind the micro:bit with your fingers, this can cause it to **completely** stop sending and receiving data from the serial port (just restart the node server in your terminal with `"rs"`, if it doesn't work, reset both the micro:bit and the server)


## What's happening
Basically, this is an aplication that allows you to plot data from the micro:bit's sensors (acceleration, magnetic orientation, and such), and put it to display in your machine. You can also, from your computer, send data and actions to the micro:bit, like a remote control. You can digitally toggle the IO pins in the microbit, or toggle a specific led on its screen, for example.

This allows you to make tests in real time with your micro:bit, without to having to code it every time. Allowing for more interactive classroom experiences with the micro:bit.





## General Objectives
#### Accelerometer
Being able to represent the data of the accelerometer of the micro:bit in both: a graph, and a 3d visual representation of the micro:bit being tilted **in real time.**

#### Buttons
Being able to make the micro:bit do something stated in the page beforehand when you press a button (having a menu that lets you pick what you want the micro:bit to do when you press a button, like, show an icon or a string in the screen).

#### Compass
Being able to represent the data of the magnetometer of the micro:bit in both: a graph, and a 3d visual representation of the micro:bit being rotated in a magnetic field **in real time.**

#### Leds
Being able to show a string or an icon in the microbit, stated by the user.

#### Pins
Have the capabilities of both reading and writing (digitally and analogically) values from and to the micro:bit IO Pins.

#### Radio
Setting the channel, sending a value, string, etc, and listenig to them when received, all remotely based on user input.
